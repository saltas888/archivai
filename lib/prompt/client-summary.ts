// Create a prompt that generates a summary based on the `service provider` and `purpose` fields of the invoices
// and the `date` of the invoice to explain the frequency of the invoices and the payments.
// Specifically, the summary should include the following information:
// 1. The frequency of the invoices/transactions  (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually)
// 2. The service provider names
// 3. The total amount of the invoices/transactions
// 4. The total amount of the payments (if applicable)

// Regenerate the summary every month, or after the first 3 invoices.
