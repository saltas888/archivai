// Based on the client summary(?), create a prompt that generates alerts based on the
// frequency of the invoices and the payments and the current date.
// For example, if the client has a rent statement every previous month,  
// and it's been more than a month since the last invoice,
// generate an alert that the client should pay the invoices.


// Idea: Maybe implement this in the UI
